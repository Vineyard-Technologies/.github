# Support

Welcome to Vineyard Technologies! We are dedicated to providing excellent support for our open-source projects.

## How to Get Support

We offer several channels for support. Please choose the one that best fits your needs.

### üêõ Bug Reports & Feature Requests

If you've found a bug or have an idea for a new feature, the best place to share it is on the project's GitHub repository.

1.  **Go to the repository's "Issues" tab.**
2.  **Search for existing issues** to see if your problem or idea has already been reported.
3.  **If not, open a new issue.** Please use the provided templates (Bug Report or Feature Request) and fill in as much detail as possible.

### üí¨ Community Discussions

For general questions, discussions, and sharing your projects, please use the "Discussions" tab in the relevant repository. This is a great place to connect with other users and the development team.
