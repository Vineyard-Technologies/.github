## Supported Projects

This security policy applies to all projects under the Vineyard Technologies organization. We provide security updates for the latest stable release of each active project.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take all security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security issue, please report it to us privately to protect our users.

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please email us at **contact@vineyardtechnologies.com**.

### What to Include

- **Project Name**: The repository or project affected.
- **Vulnerability Type**: e.g., Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), SQL Injection, Remote Code Execution, etc.
- **Detailed Description**: Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue.
- **Proof of Concept (PoC)**: Code, screenshots, or a video demonstrating the vulnerability.
- **Impact**: What an attacker could achieve by exploiting the vulnerability.
- **Your Contact Information**: So we can follow up with you.

### Our Process

1.  **Acknowledgment**: We will acknowledge receipt of your report within 48 hours.
2.  **Triage**: We will investigate and validate the vulnerability.
3.  **Remediation**: We will work on a patch to fix the issue.
4.  **Disclosure**: Once the vulnerability is patched, we will coordinate with you on public disclosure. We may issue a security advisory and credit you for your discovery.

## Security Best Practices

We encourage all our project maintainers and contributors to follow these security best practices:

- **Dependency Management**: Keep dependencies up-to-date and use tools to scan for known vulnerabilities.
- **Code Reviews**: All code changes should be reviewed for security issues before being merged.
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Grant only the necessary permissions for applications and services.
- **Data Protection**: Avoid storing sensitive data in repositories. Use secure methods for handling secrets and credentials.

Thank you for helping keep Vineyard Technologies and our users safe.
